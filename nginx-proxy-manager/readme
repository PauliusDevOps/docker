To make Cockpit proxy aware, you will need to modify the Cockpit config file located at /etc/cockpit/cockpit.conf. 
This file may not exist and if it doesn't you should create it.

    sudo nano /etc/cockpit/cockpit.conf

    [WebService]
    Origins = https://cockpit.domain.tld wss://cockpit.domain.tld
    ProtocolHeader = X-Forwarded-Proto

   sudo systemctl restart cockpit.service

Nginx as a reverse proxy for Cockpit, ensure that Nginx is configured to correctly forward TLS headers to Cockpit. 
In the Nginx configuration Advanced tab for Cockpit, add:


    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $remote_addr;
